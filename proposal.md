1: Introduction
(In the age of information, social media has revolutionized how people consume and discuss information. 
However, often, information travels faster than people are able to consume it. 
Often times, users are left "out of the loop," unsure what others are discussing. 

Worse, misinformation can easily spread through social media. In these environments,
doing your own research becomes exhaustive. Our project hopes to aleviate some of these anxieties. 
Our project will allow users to do their own research and stay up-to-date in conversations with their peers,
specifically through Twitter.) -This might make for a good introduction? Wrote it for the customer value section 
before actually reading the proposal guideline.


2: Customer Value

Our target market is Twitter users who wish to stay connected and informed.
These customers want to do their own research and come to their own conclusions,
while still being able to communicate with friends and family online. Social media has taken
center stage in the past few years, due to it's inability to present users with factual 
information- it's main goal is to present opinions and reactions, not inform users. 

Our project hopes to help fix this issue. Our solutions hopes to merge social media, in this case: Twitter,
with relevant news articles. Our browser add-on will hopefully allow Twitter users access 
to stories their friends are discussing with only a click. 
These stories will come from trusted sources curated by the Google News API. 


3: Proposed Solution & Technology

	*BRAINSTORM* 

 From our point of view, this addon is able to use the
 information stored inside the tweet (through a Twitter API)
 and return results (with a Google API). Specifically, JavaScript
 will be used to call to our Python with prompts to a server returning
 keywords to the JavaScript, those keywords will be pushed to a Google
 API (which will hopefully return the top 3 searches). A provide
 relevant information to an audience that isn't informed about the
 context. The "minimal" system that would be of use to our customer 
 would be our usage of a search engine. What makes ours unique? 
 Simple - convenience. With our implementation you can reach the 
 relevant information through a click/interaction with the addon 
 rather than use several actions/resources to reach the same result.
 Firefox has a debugging tool where we can directly test and interact 
 with our intermediate creation. 

The search results provided to the customer.
Provided background information to inform the customer.
Directly test the addon through Firefox. (about:debugging)

Build - text editor, servers able to send and recieve information. (Google Engine)
Tools - Google News API, Google APP Engine (Instances), Google Natural Language Library, Twitter Developer Tools, Python Server
