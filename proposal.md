	*BRAINSTORM* 

	From our point of view, this addon is able to use the information stored inside the tweet (through a Twitter API) and return results (with a Google API). Specifically, JavaScript will be used to call to our Python with prompts to a server returning keywords to the JavaScript, those keywords will be pushed to a Google API (which will hopefully return the top 3 searches). A provide relevant information to an audience that isn't informed about the context. The "minimal" system that would be of use to our customer would be our usage of a search engine. What makes ours unique? Simple - convenience. With our implementation you can reach the relevant information through a click/interaction with the addon rather than use several actions/resources to reach the same result. Firefox has a debugging tool where we can directly test and interact with our intermediate creation. 

The search results provided to the customer.
Provided background information to inform the customer.
