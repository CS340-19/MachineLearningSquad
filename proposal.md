2: Customer Value
In the age of information, social media has revolutionized how people consume and discuss information. However, often, information travels faster than people are able to consume it. Often times, users are left "out of the loop," unsure what others are discussing. 

Worse, misinformation can easily spread through social media. In these environments, doing your own research becomes exhaustive. Our project hopes to aleviate some of the anxieties. Our project will allow users to do their own research and stay up-to-date in conversations with their peers, specifically through Twitter.
