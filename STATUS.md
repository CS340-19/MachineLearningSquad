<h3>1: Introduction:</br></h3>
Created a REST API
For the most part no major changes to our initial plan.
</br></br></br>
<h3>2: Customer Value:</br></h3>
No change.
</br></br></br>
<h3>3:Technology:</br></h3>
For the most part, our ideas of the technology we planned on implementing is still being implemented. Our addon for Firefox is still implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We originally didn't know exactly which route we wanted to take in terms of how the addon will be formatted in the browser, but we have decided to keep the addon in the toolbar so that when the user clicks it, it will display the google search links of the top results based on the tweets content. Our overall logic for the generation of google links for the user is within python, and we implemented the twitter API, Google API, and keyword extraction as we planned that has been tested and is working. The last major piece we have left is to figure out how to communicate between the addon in JavaScript and the python script being hosted on a server.

<h3>4: Team:</br></h3>
For this iteration each member was assigned an individual part to our product as a whole. As such the stages of research to
implementation were assigned to the appropriate member. No changes currently or planned for. 
</br></br></br>
<h3>5: Project Management:</br></h3>
The product is on schedule. No updates to the schedule, since we haven't encountered a crisis yet we have been moving
as planned.
</br></br></br>
<h3>6: Reflection:</br></h3>
For this iteration our method of parsing our addon into pieces worked out for us. We were able to divide the workload
into each member depending on their interests. Each member was able to assist another if needed. However, separating
the group like this did have its own disadvantages, during the research steps if anyone struggled if it was a topic
that no one had prior knowledge of, help couldn't not be provided within the group. The group has finished the goal
to "divide and conquer" and all that is left is integration with a server. So now our group will be working as a whole
to finish the remaining parts of the product.
