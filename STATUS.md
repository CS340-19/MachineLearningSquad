as planned.

<h3>6: Reflection:</br></h3>
For this iteration our method of parsing our addon into pieces worked out for us. We were able to divide the workload
into each member depending on their interests. Each member was able to assist another if needed. However, separating
the group like this did have its own disadvantages, during the research steps if anyone struggled if it was a topic
that no one had prior knowledge of, help couldn't not be provided within the group. The group has finished the goal
to "divide and conquer" and all that is left is integration with a server. So now our group will be working as a whole
to finish the remaining parts of the product.
