<h2>Team</h2>

The overall work that each team member was assigned to applied to that team members strengths / interests, and was evenly distributed
as much as possible. There was no specific roles that each team member held throughout the project because each week we broke down
what we needed into different parts and each person was assigned to those issues accordingly. Below are the tasks / issues that each
team member worked on. 

- Jared Colburn:

- Austin Oaks:

- Kody Bloodworth:

- Tanner Fry: Worked on researching how to communicate with the Twitter API, Google API, and how to use RAKE. Implemented a very bare
bones Firefox addon and python script for communicating with the Twitter API(tweepy), the Google API, and basic usage of RAKE. My
simplistic structures was then elaborated and built upon by the other members for a more detailed design, and desired implementation
setup needed for the addon to be fully functional.
